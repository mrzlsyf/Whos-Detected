# 🔎 Whos Detected 🕶️

🚀 This project utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to identify and classify individuals whose faces are detected in real-time video streams. 📻🛠️

---

## 🎯 Overview

This system employs **deep learning techniques** for face detection and classification. Using **CNNs**, the model can recognize and differentiate between multiple individuals based on a labelled dataset.

---

## 🏠 Project Workflow 📌
1. **Face Detection** 👀: Uses Haar Cascade or a CNN-based approach to detect faces.
2. **Feature Extraction** 🔍: Extracts facial features and prepares them for classification.
3. **Identification** 🎮: Classifies the detected face against a trained model to determine the identity.
4. **Real-time Processing** ⏳: The system works in real-time for continuous face recognition.
